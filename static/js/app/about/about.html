    	<h1>About Us</h1>
    	<h3>Quick Start</h3>
    	Go right to <a href="/#/">Design your Diet</a> and start hacking away at creating a custom meal plan.
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p>
        Balancedself allows our users to create custom meal plans that meet their desired recommended daily intake of various macro nutrients (think protein, fat, and carbohydrates) and vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin C and many more). 
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are ready to go on a diet or just start eating right but don't know how to start then you have come to the right place. Our site allows you to start with one of several 'Standards'. Those standard can vary greatly. You can start with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake">US RDI</a> or you can design a paleo or keto plan. That is just the begining. After you have selected your standard you can customize the plan for you. 
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, you can start with a low carb diet. That is a great start for weight loss. What if you want a keto diet that has no dairy? You can simply list diary as an allergy and the meal plan that is created for you will have no diary products. 
        </p>

        <h3>Who we are not</h3>
        We are not doctors or nutritionist. We cannot give you specific advice on what diet would work for you but we give you the tools to design a diet that you will enjoy and can stick with.
